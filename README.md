## Welcome to Changsha

Changsha, the capital of central China’s Hunan province, is a large city with a history dating to the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 B.C.). Today it’s known for its rare collection of excavated Western Han dynasty tombs, known as the Mawangdui. It’s also associated with Mao Zedong, who studied and lived here before joining the Chinese Communist Party in the 1920s..
